#PySpace 
#####2D gravity simulator

This is one of my first programming projects, the git repo was reinitialized as it was one of the first Git-repos I ever made and was therefore _very_ messy.
I haven't made any serious effort to clean it up, I've merely tried to rewrite it in some ways to optimize performance and clean up the code a tiny bit in the process to a workable state.

Requires Python 2.7 with PyGame and NumPy
